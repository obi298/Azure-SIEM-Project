# Azure SIEM Project

<br>

# Introduction


In the modern era of technology, companies are heavily relying on their IT infrastructure in order to do their everyday tasks. And of course in the world of technology, it is important that companies are up to date on their security. Companies use SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools to monitor suspicious events within the work environment. In todayâ€™s era, SIEM tools are in higher demand due to cybersecurity threats evolving day by day. These tools allow security professionals to perform real-time analysis of the IT infrastructure and monitor the overall health of machines within an organization.

In this project, I created a VM from Azure and used it as a honeypot to expose it to the world for attackers to discover it. I collected log data from the VM by using a PowerShell Script and a Third-Party Geographic Data API and transferred that data back to Azure to create a map of the attacks from around the world. I then was able to analyze where the attacks were coming from and take note of the number of failed login attempts from different regions.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to learn the basics of Azure SIEM tools and use them to track down malicious attackers from around the globe. I have documented all the steps I have taken in order to successfully complete this project.

# Creating Virtual Machine

I created an Azure virtual machine and chose Windows 10 as my image. I intentionally made this VM vulnerable and used it as a honeypot to attract attackers from all over the world.

# Configuring VM Security Rules
<br>

I created a username and password that was used to login to the virtual machine. I also set the RDP to port 3389 in order for the virtual machine to be exposed to attackers.
<br>

I added a new security group and configured the network settings to make the virtual machine vulnerable and discoverable to attackers. The virtual machine was used as a honeypot to attract attackers from all over the world.

<br>
<br>
<br>

I deleted the old inbound security rule and added a new one. The new rule allowed the virtual machine to be exposed to attackers.

<br>
<br>
<br>

Here, I created a new log analytics workspace.

<br>
<br>
<br>


I went to the settings and enabled data collection for all events which allowed the virtual machine to capture data from attacks.

<br>
<br>
<br>



I connected the new workspace to the VM, which allowed Azure to capture log data from the VM.

<br>
<br>
<br>

 I was able to set up Microsoft Sentinel as a SIEM tool to create a map of the attacks from around the world. After that, I added Sentinel to my log analytics workspace.

# Observing Logs in Windows Event Viewer
<br>

After connecting Sentinel to my log analytics workspace, I used my public IP address to connect to the VM using RDP. 

<br>
<br>

 <br>
 <br>
 <br>

Before logging into the virtual machine, I purposefully made a few failed login attempts in order for them to be viewed as logs in Windows Event Viewer.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

After successfully logging into the VM, I went to Windows Event Viewer. I was able to see my failed event logs.  

<br>
<br>

# Collect Geographic Data from IP Address
<br>
I decided to click on one of the logs to get for information. Each log contains information such as event ID, account name, failure information, and network information.

<br>
<br>
<br>

I took the IP address from the log and entered it in a 3rd party API in order to collect geographic data. I collected geographic information from this website: www.ipgeolocation.io. 

<br>

I was able to see information such as country, state, time zone, and currency. I used this information to create my own log and sent that log into my log analytics workspace.

 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>

 # Configure Firewall Settings
 <br>

In this step, I turned off the firewall settings in order to make the VM more vulnerable to attackers. I made sure that the firewall was disabled from the domain, private, and public profile. I wanted to make the VM as vulnerable as possible in order for attackers to discover it.

<br>

<br>
<br>


After configuring the firewall settings, I tested the virtual machine's connectivity by pinging it from the local machine. I also tested the connection before configuring the firewall settings. The virtual machine was able to communicate with the local machine after disabling the firewalls.

# Collect Geographic Data from Attackers

<br>

I copied a PowerShell script from Josh Madokor that was used to collect geographic data from failed login event logs and create a log file.

<br>

<img src="https://github.com/obi298/Azure-SIEM-Project/assets/90945162/b09ce001-dab5-4009-8474-9dd8ffd955d5" alt="" width="700" height="450">

<br>
<br>
<br>

After copying the script, I pasted it on Powershell ISE.

<br>

<img src="https://github.com/obi298/Azure-SIEM-Project/assets/90945162/7a07b8ef-6f5f-4570-ba7a-85599f27296a" alt="" width="850" height="700">

<br>
<br>
<br>

I generated an API key from the 3rd party API in order for the script to work with the API.

<img src="https://github.com/obi298/Azure-SIEM-Project/assets/90945162/247f8e0f-2716-4a06-befe-e216597af8e1" alt="" width="650" height="320">

<br>
<br>
<br>

Entering the API key in the PowerShell script allowed the script to collect geographic data from attackers that were attempting to login to the virtual machine.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

After entering the API key, I ran the PowerShell script. The script was able to collect data from the API and WIndows Event Viewer. After running the script, I noticed that each error log contained a username, sourcehost, and destination host. 

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

After executing the script, I saved the log file of the error logs in a text document in order to put it in my Log Analytics workspace. I then created a custom log in order to put the geographic data in my log analytics workspace.
